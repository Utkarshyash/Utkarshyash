	<p>I’m currently building Forkast.News, an Asia-based digital media platform based in Asia covering emerging technologies at the intersection of business, economy, and politics. We’re starting with blockchain.</p>

    <p>I love building companies, teams, and ideas. As a startup operator, what matters to me most is creating the platform and community for teams feel empowered to do their best work. My professional interests include strategy & operations, media technology, design thinking, and emerging technologies.</p> 

    <p>I’ve been lucky to lead early stage startup teams in San Francisco and New York (Driver, The Muse, 42 Technologies) — doing everything from Chief of Staff, Operations, Editorial, Marketing, and Business Development.</p> 

    <p>In a previous life, I was a management consultant at McKinsey & Company and worked with teams on business innovation and strategy at Market Gravity and Virgin in London. My written work has appeared on Inc. Magazine, Time Magazine, Mashable, Lifehacker, Business Insider, Women 2.0, and The Muse.</p>
